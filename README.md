# youbot_gazebo_simulation
To startup the youbot in gazebo

Alternative Youbot simulation package using ROS controller stacks instead of controllers from KUKA. There also is a node to convert brics_actuator messages which the Youbot listens to and which are issued by Youbot control interfaces to the message types expected by the gazebo_ros controllers.
